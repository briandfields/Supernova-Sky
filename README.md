# Supernova-Sky
Based on Tanner's Monte Carlo code for Milky Way supernova distributions.  

Initial version includes changes from BDF, including:
* diagnostics of number of supernovae in different quadrants, to test for symmetries
* plots tweaked to show magnitude cutoff, and in other smaller ways
* now also makes a scatter plot showing visible and invisible supernovae
